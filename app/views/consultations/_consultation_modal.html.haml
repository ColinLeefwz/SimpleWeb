            %p When you request a Private Session with a Prodygia expert, we need to collect from you some information so that we have enough background to submit your request to the expert.
            %p Please note that our experts charge by the hour and each set her/his own rates. Exact fees will be confirmed after the request has been submitted and accepted.
            %p Submitting the request indicates the member has a serious interest in the private session and gets the process started; it does not, however, represent a commitment to go through with the private session; that commitment and final confirmation will take place later in the process.
