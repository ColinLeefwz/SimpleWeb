      China's opening up is one of the biggest stories of the early 21st Century. The IMF estimates that China's economy will reach US$ 19 trillion in 2016 and surpass the United States to become the largest in the world.

    %p
      Yet for the West, China is and will continue to be an enigma. To understand and partake in China's growth over the next decades, it is essential to become better informed about how things work inside the country. 

    %p 
      Today, apart from moving to China and experiencing the country first-hand, typical ways of seeking insights such as desktop research, tapping into one's personal network, and using specialized service providers. These methods are fine, and will continue to be used, but are limited as solutions in our view. 

    %p
      The reality is that most people do not even know where to start to get relevant information or find the right contacts.
    
    %p.latoitalic 
      At Prodygia, we figured there must be a better way to connect you with the Real China, and we decided to do something about it. Prodygia will give you the power to 'log into China'. We aim to be your trusted, online marketplace for expertise on China.

    %p 
      Prodygia enables Members to search more effectively for China expertise, and Experts to share and monetize their expertise via innovative marketing channels. The result is a more targeted, holistic and efficient approach to matching demand for and supply of expertise on China 

    %p 
      Then, thanks to a combination of live and recorded online sessions (release date set for early 2014), members will have a chance to get practical, personalized advice to increase their learning curves on topics of their interest and achieve specific goals.

    %p 
      We met in Shanghai over a decade ago (2003) and became each others' first friends in China. 

    %p 
      As 
      %span.latoitalic foreigners
      with no local contacts or language skills at the time, we quickly realized how much we didn't know, plus what an exceptional opportunity lay ahead of us to grow. The learning curves were steep and it was a humbling experience for sure, but it kept us on our toes.

    %p 
      Over the years, as we worked with international companies doing business in China and played host to visiting Western friends, we saw first-hand how important it was becoming for them to learn about and understand China. In most cases, there was a massive gap between what they expected China to be like and what they experienced on the ground. 

    %p
      Prodygia is our attempt to help you reduce that gap. We learned about China from thousands of conversations with insiders, and a chance to have those conversations is now being offered to you on this platform, whether or not you are based in China.
