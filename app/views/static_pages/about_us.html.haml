      China's opening up is one of the biggest stories of the early 21st Century. Estimates suggest its economy will reach US$ 19 trillion in 2016 and surpass the United States to become the largest economy in the world
      %a{href: "#footnote1", name: "footnote1_source"}*
      \.

    %p Yet for the West, China is and will continue to be an enigma. To understand and partake in China's growth over the next decades, it is essential to become better informed about how things work inside the country.

    %p Today, apart from moving to China and experiencing the country first-hand, typical ways of seeking insights include:
    
    %ol
      %li Desktop research (often fragmented, biased and politicized, too general or not on target)
      %li Tapping into one's personal network to find someone who can help (might  be imposing on others and time consuming)
      %li Using specialized service providers (costly, time consuming, and quality may vary)
                           
    %p The reality is that most people do not even know where to start to obtain relevant information or find the right contacts at reasonable cost.
    %p At Prodygia, we figured there must be a better way to connect you with the Real China, and we decided to do something about it.
    %p Prodygia will give you the power to 'log into China.' We aim to be your trusted, online marketplace for expertise on China. 
    %p 
      It will offer you a unique experience: 
      %strong virtual immersion.

    %p Prodygia enables Members to search more effectively for China expertise, and experts to promote and monetize their expertise via innovative marketing channels.  The result is a more targeted, holistic and efficient approach to matching demand for and supply of expertise on China.

    %p Then, thanks to a combination of live and recorded online sessions (release date set for early 2014), members will have a chance to get practical, personalized advice to increase their learning curve and achieve specific goals.

      %p We met in Shanghai a decade ago (2003) and became each others' first friends in China. 

      %p As foreigners with no local contacts or language skills at the time, we quickly realized how much we didn't know, plus what an exceptional opportunity lay ahead of us to grow. The learning curves were steep and it was a humbling experience for sure, but it kept us on our toes. 

      %p Over the years, as we played host to countless Western friends and business contacts visiting China, we saw first-hand how interest in understanding China was rising. We witnessed a massive gap between what they expected China to be like and what they experienced on the ground. Prodygia is our attempt to help you reduce that gap.

      %p Of course, you don't just have to take our word for it. We've learned about China from thousands of conversations with insiders. A chance to have those conversations is now being offered to you on this platform, even if you're not based in China or have Chinese friends.

      %p I built a consulting business from the ground up during my time in China. Its mission was to help international companies enter and grow their operations in the Chinese market. Earlier in my career, I was a management consultant at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Vice President of Strategy at Auripay, project leader at Barilla, and contributed to startups in the U.S. and Europe. 

      %p I earned a Laurea from Polictecnico di Milano and an MBA from Kellogg Business School.

      %p My interests include long distance running, diving, cooking, chess, meditation, and anything related to entrepreneurship and internet technologies. Oh, and I also make a decent pizza.
