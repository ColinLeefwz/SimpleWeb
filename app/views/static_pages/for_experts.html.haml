        %a{name: "toolkit"} The Expert Toolkit
      %p As a Prodygian Expert you can take full advantage of the platform through a set of functionality which we call the Expert's Toolkit.
      %p The Toolkit allows you to do a number of things, some which are free to members - such as posting content and various community features - while other requires members to enroll for a fee, letting you monetize your China expertise. These include pre-recorded video-on-demand, live teleconferencing (1 to 1 and 1 to many), and live streaming.
      %p Of course, the more active you are on the platform using the full portfolio of functionality, the more you and your community will benefit from it.
      %p We are currently working hard to empower our Experts with the full Toolkit, as new functionality will be released during the next few months.
