    <p>I'm using a new website and thought it could be useful for you as well since you know a lot about China. It's called Prodygia (<a href='http://www.prodygia.com'>www.prodygia.com</a>) and aims to provide Western organizations and individuals with a more practical way to learn about China online.</p>
    <p>Experts like you and me can post articles, record short video interviews, sell video courses and share these via social networks to our clients, students, or friends. The topics vary from business and entrepreneurship to technology and culture. It basically offers you a virtual channel to promote content which you have been delivering mainly offline - that is to say in person - until now and scale to audiences around the world. </p>
    <p>Take a look at the site and if you are curious to learn more, go ahead and email experts@prodygia.com with details about your area(s) of expertise and background. They will be thrilled to hear from you!</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
